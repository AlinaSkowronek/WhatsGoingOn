## WhatsGoingOn
A website that will show you what's going on at CU Boulder! Event locations are displayed over a map of CU Boulder, with interactable markers being able to expand to view the event's date, time, description, and more.

## Build Instructions
Clone the repository, create a .env file in the root (WhatsGoingOn/) that includes a google maps API key, session secret and postgres login.
