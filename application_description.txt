Our application will modernize on campus events for organizers and students alike. Gone are the days of free 
stuff being avalible on campus without students knowing. What's Going On is a simple user interface that shows 
all events taking place on campus that day, with additional information as to what the event is and if there are 
free items avalible for students. For organizers, events can be registered for free on What's Going On to help 
drive engagment at their events. 

Our implementation of this website will be as follows: we will have a PostGres SQL database that will store all 
events taking place on that day, with data memebers to account for all relevant information (location, time, 
giveaways, ect.). Then, through the database, we will populate a map of the CU Boulder campus with the location
of the events, which will constitute the majority of the UI. Users can also search for specific events or filter by
event type based on their specific need.

Our product is a win-win for everyone: event organizers get more exposure, and students get more stuff.
